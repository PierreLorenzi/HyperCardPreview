HyperCardPreview is an Mac OS X application that can display HyperCard stacks, with an look
very faithful to the original. It makes the stack files alive again in the Finder with
their real icons, so they don't appear as "binaries", and provides a QuickLook plug-in.

It can only visualize the stacks: it can't modify them, and it can't execute them. But it lets
the user inspect the stacks, backgrounds, cards, buttons and fields, see theirs scripts and
get their text contents. To inspect an object, type command-option and click on it.

Features:
- can open HyperCard v1 and v2 stacks,
- uses bitmap fonts so it feels like the old days,
- reads the resources of the stacks to get the icons and fonts,
- programmed in Swift, doesn't use any deprecated API.
